Adding in table deck system, and the ablility to remove cards from table's face up cards and replace them, which is combined with the purchase function.

Currently the card setting function uses random choice to extract 4 cards, and for some reason sometimes chooses cards not in the deck? Very odd error.
But in real life games you don't randomly take the cards, you take them from the top.
Thus, I can remove this random element here and hopefully remove this bug.

TODO: Change the card setting function to use .pop() and not .remove(). Don't use random.
